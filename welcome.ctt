  Welcome to the web version of cubicaltt!

  cubicaltt - is an experimental implementation of Cubical Type Theory
  in which the user can directly manipulate n-dimensional cubes.

  This page offers cubicaltt builded with GHCJS and a simple JavaScript
  application using Monaco editor. The idea is to bring Emacs
  experience directly to the browser.

  There are five tabs: this message and four great lectures by Anders MÃ¶rtberg.
  
  To load the editor's tab use Ctrl + L. It will type check
  the code and load definitions. That will allow to play with them
  in the REPL which can be noticed on the right. 

  Have a nice day and good luck in learning Cubical Type Theory!
